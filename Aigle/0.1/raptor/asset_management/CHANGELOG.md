- Integration with **SeaweedFS** cluster for object storage (3 masters, 4 volumes, replication `011`).
- S3-compatible API via `seaweedfs-s3`.

- Full observability with Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Node Exporter.
- NFS volume mounting with automated directory creation (`ensure_nfs_dirs.sh`).
- Docker Compose orchestration for all services.
- Automated daily scheduled jobs:
  - `auto_archive_assets` at 00:00.
  - `auto_destroy_assets` at 01:00.
  - `lakefs_gc` at 02:00.
- Centralized backup of SeaweedFS filer data.
- Implemented MCP server for asset management API, providing a unified interface for agents to interact with the service.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-19
### Added
- Support for multi-user, branch-based asset management.
- Added functionality to separate branches based on owner name (e.g., username: `Alice` → branch: `Alice_space`).
- Support for two usage scenarios: individual usage or collaborative usage (admin creates a branch space and can create shared users with configurable permissions).
- Added ability to manage shared users (create, update, delete) under a branch.
- Added `TIMEZONE` in `.env` to unify time definition across services.

### Changed
- Adjusted internal service initialization process and refactored part of the logic to support multi-user / multi-branch functionality.
- Updated API logic:
  
  | Endpoint        | Method | JWT Auth | Description |
  |-----------------|--------|------|-------------|
  | `/users`        | POST   | ❌   | Create a new user (initial admin / branch owner). Branch is automatically assigned. |
  | `/shared-users` | POST   | ✅   | Create a shared user under the current user's branch. |
  | `/shared-users` | DELETE | ✅   | Delete a shared user under the current user's branch. |
  | `/shared-users` | PUT    | ✅   | Update a shared user's permissions under the current user's branch. |

- Removed unused `/set-access-policy` endpoint as file-level access is now governed by user permissions instead of per-file policies.
- Docker Compose now pins explicit image versions instead of using `latest`, ensuring reproducible deployments and preventing unexpected upgrades:
  - `chrislusf/seaweedfs:3.96`
  - `qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.1`
  - `mysql:8.0`
  - `prom/prometheus:2.48.0`
  - `prom/alertmanager:v0.28.1`
  - `prom/node-exporter:v1.9.1`
  - `grafana/grafana:12.0.2`
  - `treeverse/lakefs:1.65.2`
  - `app` (built from local Dockerfile)
  - `lakefs-gc-cron` (built from `./docker_compose_settings/lakefs/gc-runner`)
- `.env` no longer includes `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Admin users are not auto-created; they must now be created explicitly via the `/users` API.

### Fixed
- N/A

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-09
### Added
- Added custom Dockerfile and entrypoint script for Alertmanager to support environment-variable-based configuration.

### Changed
- Changed the healthcheck method in docker compose for lakefs.
- Removed unused imports for cleaner code.
- Updated `lakefs-gc-cron` Dockerfile to use `apache/spark:3.5.7` instead of deprecated `bitnami/spark:3.5`.
- Alertmanager configuration now uses environment variables instead of static YAML values for SMTP credentials and email recipients.
- Updated docker-compose for Alertmanager to use build context instead of image.
- Auto-daily archive and destroy times are now configurable via environment variables and read through `config.py`, instead of being hardcoded to `00:00` and `01:00`.
- Temporarily disabled Qdrant write operations in `client.py`. Only `archive` and `destroy` actions remain active, as real-world scenarios typically delay Qdrant storage until additional metadata is available.
- Commented out the `qdrant` service in `docker-compose.yaml`; in real deployments, the application should connect to an **external Qdrant instance** instead.  
  For testing Qdrant connectivity, the service can still be started locally, and the write operations in `client.py` can be re-enabled.

### Fixed

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-17

### Added
- **Documentation:** Added a **System Architecture Diagram** to `README.md` to provide a high-level overview of the microservices, data flow, and technologies used (e.g., FastAPI, LakeFS, Qdrant, MySQL, SeaweedFS).

### Changed
- **Documentation:** Updated the **API Data Flow Diagrams** in `README.md`.

### Fixed
- N/A

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- N/A

### Changed
- **Documentation:** Updated the **User Management Data Flow Diagram** in `README.md`.

### Fixed
- N/A

## [0.1.4] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- N/A

### Changed
- Replaced datetime.now() with datetime.now(timezone.utc) to ensure UTC timestamps in JWT
- Added 'jti' (JWT ID) claim for better tracking and unique identification of JWTs
- Added tests for the new timestamp handling and jti claim functionality

### Fixed
- N/A

---

## [0.1.5] - 2025-11-03

### Added
- N/A

### Changed
- **Docker Compose:** Optimized the `docker-compose.yaml` configuration by removing unnecessary port mappings from the internal services (e.g., internal databases, storage services) to the Host. Only essential ports for external services like the **Asset Management Service**, **LakeFS**, **Grafana**, and **Prometheus** remain mapped, reducing the host's exposed surface area.
- **Documentation:** Updated the relevant sections in `README.md` to reflect the changes in Docker Compose port mappings.
- **SeaweedFS Filer:** Improved the Filer configuration process. Configuration is no longer dependent on the static `filer.toml` file but is now read from **`.env`** environment variables, enhancing deployment flexibility and configurability.

### Fixed
- N/A
